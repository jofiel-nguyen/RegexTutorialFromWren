# Regex Tutorial

Regular expressions (regex) are effective tools for text manipulation and pattern matching. In addition to pattern building blocks, searching, repetition, grouping, anchoring, alternation, lookarounds, and advanced approaches, this lesson also covers the fundamentals of regex. You will learn how to use regex and alter textual data through explanations, examples, and exercises.


## Summary

Regular expressions are covered in detail in this regex lesson, covering anchors, quantifiers, grouping strategies, bracket expressions, character classes, the OR operator, flags, and character escapes. To help you comprehend and efficiently utilize regular expressions, the course offers explanations, examples, and tasks.

Explanation of anchors in regular expressions and their usage.
Examples of using the start anchor ^ and end anchor $.
Demonstration of how anchors can enforce specific placement requirements.

### Quantifiers
Explanation of quantifiers in regular expressions and their purpose.
Overview of commonly used quantifiers such as *, +, ?, {n}, {n,}, and {n,m}.
Usage examples to demonstrate quantifiers in action.
Explanation of greedy and non-greedy matching with quantifiers.

### Grouping Constructs
Explanation of grouping constructs and their role in regex.
Introduction to capturing groups, alternation, and grouping for operators.
Demonstration of how parentheses are used to create and apply grouping constructs.
Example showcasing the use of grouping constructs in a regex pattern.
### Bracket Expressions
Introduction to bracket expressions (character classes) in regular expressions.
Explanation of defining character sets using square brackets [].
Usage examples of matching specific characters and ranges.
Introduction to negation with the caret symbol ^ in bracket expressions.
### Character Classes
Explanation of character classes in regular expressions.
Demonstration of using character classes to match specific sets of characters.
Examples of common character classes like vowels, digits, and letters.
Introduction to negating character classes.
### The OR Operator
Explanation of the OR operator (|) in regular expressions.
Overview of how to specify alternative options using the OR operator.
Usage examples to illustrate the functionality of the OR operator.

### Flags
Explanation of flags or modifiers in regular expressions.
Introduction to commonly used flags such as case-insensitive (i), global (g), and multiline (m).
Examples of how flags can modify the behavior of regex matching.

### Character Escapes
Introduction to character escapes in regular expressions.
Explanation of using backslash \ to match special characters literally.
Examples of commonly used character escapes such as \d, \w, and \s.
Demonstrating the need for character escapes in specific scenarios.
